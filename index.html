  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <p>
  Completing the Computer Science program and building my ePortfolio have helped me clearly show the technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and professional mindset I’ve developed over the past few years. When I first started the program, I had a general interest in software and security, but working through each course helped me understand what I enjoy most and what I’m capable of. The capstone course brought all my experiences together by having me improve past projects, connect them to program outcomes, and present them in a polished way. This process made me reflect on how much I’ve grown as a developer and helped me feel more prepared to move toward my career goals in software engineering and security.
  </p>

  <p>
  Throughout the program, I learned how to work better in team environments. In CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle, I was introduced to Agile methods like sprint planning, stand-ups, and backlog refinement. Practicing these ideas during class projects taught me how to organize tasks and work in small, manageable steps. These experiences helped me during my internship at AWS, where the teams also use Agile. Because I already knew the basics, I was able to participate right away without needing extra time to learn how the process worked.
  </p>

  <p>
  I also built strong communication and planning skills in courses like CS 255 System Analysis and Design. In that class, I created Gantt charts to lay out project timelines and show how different tasks depended on each other. Understanding how to plan work visually became very useful during my internship when I needed to organize tasks and communicate timelines with the security team. These experiences also helped me explain technical decisions more clearly when discussing API activity, risks, or IAM issues with supervisors.
  </p>

  <p>
  Data structures and algorithms were another major part of my growth. In CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned about complexity, recursion, searching, sorting, and how to choose the right structure for a problem. This knowledge became especially important when I enhanced my Binary Search Tree (BST) Course Planner for Artifact 2. Improving that project required me to think about runtime performance and correctness, and it strengthened how I approach technical problems in general.
  </p>

  <p>
  Software engineering and database work also helped me with full-stack development skills. In CS 465 Full Stack Development, I built and improved the Travlr Getaways application, which became Artifacts 1 and 3 in my portfolio. Using Node.js, Express, Angular, Handlebars, and MongoDB taught me how the front end and back end connect, how MVC architecture works, and how to build APIs and manage data. These skills also supported my security work at AWS, because understanding how applications are built made it easier to identify issues or misconfigurations.
  </p>

  <p>
  My ePortfolio artifacts show how these skills all fit together. The Travlr Getaways project demonstrates my ability to work on a full-stack application using modern tools, while the BST artifact shows my ability to work with algorithms and data structures in a meaningful way. Together, these artifacts highlight my progress as a computer science student and show that I am prepared to continue growing in software and security engineering.
