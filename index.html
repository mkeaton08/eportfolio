  <h1>My ePortfolio</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 500; margin-top: 0;">Matthew A. Keaton</h2>

  <!-- Intro Summary -->
  <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #333; text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">
    I created this ePortfolio to showcase my growth as a computer science student and to highlight the projects, skills,
    and professional experiences that have shaped my development in software engineering and security. This portfolio brings
    together my major academic artifacts, enhancement work, and reflections that demonstrate my readiness to contribute
    effectively in modern technical environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <h3>Program Growth and Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    Completing the Computer Science program and building my ePortfolio have helped me clearly show the technical skills,
    problem-solving abilities, and professional mindset I’ve developed over the past few years. When I first started the
    program, I had a general interest in software and security, but working through each course helped me understand what I
    enjoy most and what I’m capable of. The capstone course brought all my experiences together by having me improve past
    projects, connect them to program outcomes, and present them in a polished way. This process made me reflect on how much
    I’ve grown as a developer and helped me feel more prepared to move toward my career goals in software engineering and
    security.
  </p>

  <h3>Team Collaboration Experience</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout the program, I learned how to work better in team environments. In CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle,
    I was introduced to Agile methods like sprint planning, stand-ups, and backlog refinement. Practicing these ideas during
    class projects taught me how to organize tasks and work in small, manageable steps. These experiences helped me during
    my internship at AWS, where the teams also use Agile. Because I already knew the basics, I was able to participate right
    away without needing extra time to learn how the process worked.
  </p>

  <h3>Communication and Project Planning Skills</h3>
  <p>
    I also built strong communication and planning skills in courses like CS 255 System Analysis and Design. In that class,
    I created Gantt charts to lay out project timelines and show how different tasks depended on each other. Understanding
    how to plan work visually became very useful during my internship when I needed to organize tasks and communicate
    timelines with the security team. These experiences also helped me explain technical decisions more clearly when
    discussing API activity, risks, or IAM issues with supervisors.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Structures & Algorithms Foundation</h3>
  <p>
    Data structures and algorithms were another major part of my growth. In CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned
    about complexity, recursion, searching, sorting, and how to choose the right structure for a problem. This knowledge
    became especially important when I enhanced my Binary Search Tree (BST) Course Planner for Artifact 2. Improving that
    project required me to think about runtime performance and correctness, and it strengthened how I approach technical
    problems in general.
  </p>

  <h3>Software Engineering & Database Skills</h3>
  <p>
    Software engineering and database work also helped me with full-stack development skills. In CS 465 Full Stack
    Development, I built and improved the Travlr Getaways application, which became Artifacts 1 and 3 in my portfolio. Using
    Node.js, Express, Angular, Handlebars, and MongoDB taught me how the front end and back end connect, how MVC architecture
    works, and how to build APIs and manage data. These skills also supported my security work at AWS, because understanding
    how applications are built made it easier to identify issues or misconfigurations.
  </p>

  <h3>Security Awareness and Mindset</h3>
  <p>
    Security became a major part of my learning as I went through the program, especially in my Information Security concentration.
    Courses like CYB 200 Cybersecurity Foundations, CYB 210 Computer Networking, and IT 253 Computer Systems Security taught me the
    basics of how networks work, how systems stay protected, and how attackers try to break into them. These classes gave me the
    groundwork I needed to understand real security problems during my internship at AWS, where I used CloudTrail to watch for 
    unusual API activity and looked at IAM roles to make sure permissions were not too open.
  </p>

  <h3>Portfolio Summary</h3>
  <p>
    My ePortfolio artifacts show how these skills all fit together. The Travlr Getaways project demonstrates my ability to
    work on a full-stack application using modern tools, while the BST artifact shows my ability to work with algorithms and
    data structures in a meaningful way. Together, these artifacts highlight my progress as a computer science student and
    show that I am prepared to continue growing in software and security engineering.
