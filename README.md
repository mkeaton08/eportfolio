CS-499 Computer Science Capstone – ePortfolio Repository

This repository contains all files for my CS-499 Capstone project at Southern New Hampshire University. It includes my original artifacts, enhanced artifacts, narratives, code review materials, and the HTML pages used to build my GitHub Pages ePortfolio.

The live ePortfolio site can be viewed here:

Repository Structure
/code-review/

Contains files related to the informal code review required for the capstone.
Includes my walkthrough of the original artifacts, planned enhancements, and explanations of code functionality.

/enhancements/

Contains the enhanced versions of my artifacts.
Each enhancement aligns with one of the three CS-499 categories:

Software Engineering & Design

Algorithms & Data Structures

Databases

This folder includes updated code reflecting improvements made during Milestones Two, Three, and Four.

/narratives/

Contains the written enhancement narratives for each artifact.
Each narrative explains:

What the artifact is

Why it was selected

What enhancements were made

How the work demonstrates mastery of course outcomes

What was learned during the process

/original/

Contains the original, unmodified versions of my artifacts before enhancements.
This allows instructors and viewers to compare the initial code to the improved versions in /enhancements.

HTML Files

These files form the public-facing GitHub Pages portfolio:

index.html
The homepage containing my professional self-assessment and introduction to the portfolio.

artifacts.html
A page that links to each artifact’s original and enhanced versions, along with the written narratives.

These pages follow UI/UX expectations for clean navigation and readability.

professional-self-assessment.docx

A standalone version of my professional self-assessment submitted with the final project.
This document offers a full reflection on my growth throughout the CS program and how the artifacts demonstrate my readiness for professional work.

Purpose of the Repository

This repository brings together:

All required technical artifacts

Their enhanced versions

Narrative documentation

My code review

A fully functioning GitHub Pages ePortfolio

It serves as both an academic submission and a professional portfolio showcasing my skills in software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security.
