CS-499 Computer Science Capstone – ePortfolio Repository

This repository contains all files for my CS-499 Capstone project at Southern New Hampshire University. It includes my original artifacts, enhanced artifacts, narratives, code review materials, and the HTML pages used to build my GitHub Pages ePortfolio.

Live ePortfolio:
https://mkeaton08.github.io/eportfolio/

Repository Structure
code-review/

Contains files related to the informal code review required for the capstone.
This includes the walkthrough of the original artifacts, planned enhancements, and explanations of core functionality.

enhancements/

Contains the enhanced versions of my artifacts.
Each enhancement aligns with one of the three CS-499 categories:

Software Engineering & Design

Algorithms & Data Structures

Databases

These files represent the improved code developed during Milestones Two, Three, and Four.

narratives/

Includes the written enhancement narratives for each artifact.
Each narrative explains:

What the artifact is

Why it was selected

What enhancements were made

How the work demonstrates course outcomes

What I learned during the enhancement process

original/

Contains the unmodified versions of each artifact before enhancements were applied.
This allows comparison between the original code and the improved code in /enhancements.

HTML Files

These files make up the GitHub Pages site for the ePortfolio.

index.html
Homepage containing my professional self-assessment and introduction to the portfolio.

artifacts.html
Artifact navigation page linking to original code, enhanced code, and written narratives.

Both pages are designed for clean UI/UX and easy navigation.

professional-self-assessment.docx

A standalone document containing my full professional self-assessment as required for final submission.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository brings together all required components of the CS-499 capstone:

Original and enhanced artifacts

Artifact narratives

Code review materials

Professional self-assessment

A complete GitHub Pages ePortfolio

It functions as both an academic submission and a professional portfolio demonstrating my abilities in software engineering, algorithms, databases, and security.CS-499 Computer Science Capstone – ePortfolio Repository
